**_Belle is a fictional character in Disney's Beauty and the Beast franchise, first appearing in the 1991 animated film of the same name. Voiced by Paige O'Hara, Belle is the book-loving daughter of an inventor, who yearns for adventure. When her father, Maurice, is imprisoned by an unkind beast in his enchanted castle, Belle offers her own freedom in exchange for his. Despite his outward appearance, she gradually befriends the Beast, who softens towards her and others in return._**

**_Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an animated musical with a strong heroine, for which he hired first-time screenwriter Linda Woolverton. Basing her on the heroine of the fairy tale of the same name, Woolverton adapted Belle into a more proactive character for the film, deliberately conceiving her as a feminist to curtail criticisms Disney had long received for purportedly portraying female characters as victims._**
